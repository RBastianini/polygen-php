/**
 * Converts an AtomSequence into a production.
 *
 * Given a sequence, where some of its contents are AtomSequences, returns a new Sequence built as follows.
 * The start of the new sequence is identical to the old sequence, up to the first AtomSequence. Similarly, the end of
 * the new sequence is identical to the end of the starting sequence, from the next Atom after the last AtomSequence,
 * to the end of the sequence.
 *
 * In the middle, the new sequence contains a Subproduction.
 * This Subproduction contains as many sequences as the cardinality of any (and all) the AtomSequences in the starting
 * sequence.
 * The first Sequence in the Subproduction consists of the first Atom of the first AtomSequence, followed by all the
 * Atoms until the next AtomSequence, then the first Atom of the second AtomSequence, followed by all the Atoms
 * until the next AtomSequence, and so on until the last element is the first Atom of the last AtomSequence.
 * The second Sequence in the Subproduction starts with the second Atom of the first AtomSequence, followed by all
 * the Atoms until the next AtomSequence, then the second Atom of the second AtomSequence, followed by all the Atoms
 * until the next AtomSequence, until the last Atom is the first second Atom of the last AtomSequence.
 * And so on...
